# Generative AI

**Generative AI** (GenAI) generates digital content from natural language prompts, enabling content creation once exclusive to humans.

## Overview

GenAI is built on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, trained on vast amounts of data from the internet. These models can produce complex responses to language prompts. Notably, ChatGPT demonstrated the ability to generate text-based results.

Beyond text, GenAI can create images, video, music, and even code. This technology is now being explored for uses such as discovering new molecules and creating 3D designs.

### Foundation Models

Generative AI leverages foundation models to perform diverse tasks, ranging from text generation to digital content creation. These models use vast pre-trained data and can be fine-tuned with minimal additional input.

### Intelligence and Creativity

While computers can already perform tasks like math and data processing, GenAI systems now excel at generating creative content, including:

- Writing stories and poems
- Analyzing tone and emotion in text
- Creating unique images and video

### Is It Art?

When Jason Allenâ€™s AI-generated work won first place at the Colorado State Fair, it raised questions about whether GenAI creations can be considered art. Just as photography was once debated, the conversation around AI-generated art continues, with opinions on both sides.

### Applications

Generative AI is being used for various types of content, including:

- [Images](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ai/generative-ai/images)
- [Music](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ai/generative-ai/music)
- [Code](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ai/generative-ai/code)

Additional areas of application include text-to-speech, scientific discovery, medical imaging, and 3D modeling.

### Legal and Ethical Considerations

Legal frameworks for Generative AI are still evolving. Issues like copyright infringement and the ethics of using AI-generated content are under debate. US laws, such as the Fair Use Copyright Act of 1976, allow some uses of copyrighted material without explicit permission, particularly for transformative purposes.

### Impact on Jobs and Future Possibilities

Generative AI will likely impact millions of jobs, especially those involving repetitive tasks. However, it also offers opportunities for new types of creativity and productivity. In areas like media, coding, and video creation, GenAI has the potential to democratize content creation, allowing more individuals to participate.
